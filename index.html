               href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33161755/lebron-james-kevin-durant-named-captains-all-star-game-starter-pool-announced">NBA
               revealed the 10 players</a> voted in as starters along with the two All-Star captains who will draft
            their teams for the eventual showdown in Cleveland on Feb. 20.</p>
         <br>
         <p class="comforter">
            As of the last public reveal of the fan vote,
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a>
            star <a target="_blank" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james">LeBron James</a> had
            surpassed Golden State Warriors rival <a target="_blank"
               href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james">Stephen Curry</a> as the leading
            vote-getter in the West, putting him in line to be a
            captain for the fifth consecutive year. Curry, meanwhile, was in a tight race with the Dallas Mavericks'
            Luka Doncic and Memphis Grizzlies' Ja Morant to be a starter at guard. The race was even closer in the
            East,
            in which three players are separated by fewer than 200,000 votes for the second guard spot.

         <p class="comforter">
            Before the starters were announced Thursday night, we asked our experts to break down
            those two races, plus three other big All-Star questions, including which player could join Morant as a
            first-time All-Star in 2022.

            1. Which of the three leading vote-getters among West guards (Curry, Doncic, Morant) should NOT be an
            All-Star starter?
         </h2>
         <br>
         <p>
            <span>Kendra Andrews:</span> Surprisingly, this came down to Curry and Doncic, but Doncic is
            the one who should not be an
            All-Star starter. Morant has been the most jaw-dropping player to watch, and the way he has led the
            Grizzlies to the third seed in the West -- ahead of the Mavericks, Utah Jazz and Denver Nuggets -- makes him
            untouchable in this category. Both Curry and Doncic have had their shooting woes this season, but Curry is
            still the greatest shooter of all time and deserves to be a starter.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
            <span>Jamal Collier:</span> Doncic. Curry and Morant have been the best players on two of the top teams in
            the
            conference. The success of both the Warriors and Grizzlies has been relatively surprising compared to
            preseason expectations, all while Curry and Morant have authored some of the most thrilling moments and
            jaw-dropping on-court performances. Doncic and the Mavericks finally started clicking in January, but the
            other two guards had already staked their claim into the early MVP discussion.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
            <span>Kirk Goldsberry:</span> Doncic because his individual numbers haven't been great -- both his scoring
            and efficiency
            numbers have dipped since last season -- and because he's looking up at those other two guys in the Western
            standings. Curry is slumping but he's still an MVP candidate who is a fan favorite, while Morant is both a
            human highlight film and the breakout star for Memphis. A Curry-Morant backcourt seems pretty electrifying
            to me.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
            <span>Tim MacMahon:</span> Doncic is the least deserving based on his relatively slow start, which was due
            in large part
            because he reported to camp out of shape. He has had recent performances that indicate he's rounding into
            first-team All-NBA form -- and he's still a top-10 scorer and nightly triple-double threat -- but Curry and
            Morant have been more impactful and spectacular.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
            <span>Kevin Pelton:</span> I actually went with Phoenix Suns guard Chris Paul as my second starter. Morant
            and Doncic
            represent an extreme example of how much weight to put on the first half of this season -- where Morant has
            blown up on the court -- vs. acknowledging an established level of play. Of them, I'd lean to the Grizzlies'
            guard. But Paul hits the sweet spot of consistent greatness, ranking ahead of them in value metrics because
            he has been healthy all season.

         <h2>2. Which of the four leading vote-getters among East guards (DeMar DeRozan, Zach LaVine, Trae Young and
            James Harden) should get the two starting spots?</h2>
         <br>
         <p class="shadow">
            <span>Collier:</span> DeRozan and Young, as long as we're OK with ignoring that DeRozan is a frontcourt
            player for the Chicago Bulls. He's having, perhaps, the best season of his career to help carry Chicago to
            its best start in a decade, which gives him the nod over LaVine, his teammate. Even though Atlanta's record
            has been one of the league's biggest disappointments in the first half, Young has carried the Hawks to an
            elite offense. Young is having the best season of his career and although Harden has been fantastic
            recently, he has taken a step back from his usual excellence.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p class="ident">
            <span>MacMahon:</span> How DeRozan is listed as a guard is another discussion, but he's at the top of this
            list of candidates. I'll go with Young as the second guard from the East. You could hold the Hawks' record
            against him, but Atlanta's run to the East finals last postseason should have put to rest the argument that
            Young isn't a winner. He's the only player in the league to rank top-five in scoring and assists, and is one
            of the game's great showmen.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p class="let-sp">
            <span>Goldsberry:</span> I'm going with the veterans here for a few reasons. First, check this out: DeRozan
            and Harden were born 19 days apart in August 1989 in Los Angeles. They grew up together, and if they started
            in the backcourt together, it would be awesome. Second, you can justify this choice with their performances.
            Young has been impressive, but it hasn't translated to winning in the ways the other three players have
            done. I'll give DeRozan the nod over LaVine because he has been so special -- those buzzer-beaters, hello!
            -- in his first season in Chicago, and Harden deserves respect for combining scoring and assists in ways
            that have kept the Brooklyn Nets near the top of the East.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p class="word-sp">
            <span>Andrews:</span> DeRozan is a lock. He has been an absolute game-changer for the Bulls and has been the
            biggest key -- not LaVine -- to them having the second-best record in the East. Looking at the other
            candidates: Harden's numbers haven't been great, but he's on the Nets. Young has played extremely well, but
            the Hawks aren't winning as much. That being said, Young should get the other starting job in the East's
            backcourt. He's currently fifth in scoring and is coming off an Eastern Conference Player of the Week
            showing that highlighted how lethal he has been.
